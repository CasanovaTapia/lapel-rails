               <h4>How do I participate?</h4>
               <h5>As previously noted, the majority of clients are the result of either club affiliation or referrals from existing Lapel Gentlemen. Membership is severely limited, as high volume is oft associated with diminishing service.<br />For all membership inquiries, please apply at www.lapel.co.<br />However, it is highly recommended that any application come attached with the endorsement of a Gentleman in good standing.</h5>
